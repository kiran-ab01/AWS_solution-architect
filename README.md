only using public ip we can access the aws in cmd.private ip will not change if we stop and start intance.
if we don't want our public ipv4 need to change we can make use of elastic ips: in the elastic ip-> allocate elastic ip-> create ipv4.
open elastic ip ->action-> associate elastic ip address->select instance.

# placement groups
to create placemnt group-> network & security->placment group-> create placment group->name->select placmnet strategy->select sprade level->and create 
while creating new instance in advance setting.

# EC2 Hibernate
while creating an instance in advance setting we can enable hibernate behaviour->ebs volume must be encrypte.
uptime-> we can get the information about how many mints inntance is up in cmd.
if we add hibernate to the instance and start and stop the instance it will calculate the instance time by adding all.

# LB sticky 
if we enable the elastic load balance for a user it will navigate to the particular user to particlar instance.
# elastic load balancer -SSL certificate
ssl(secured socket layer: used to encrypt connections) certification allows trafic between your clients and load balancer to be encrypted.
TLS(transport layer security). public ssl certificate is issued by certificate authority and this sslis attched to load balancer to encrypt connection between client and load balancer.
SSl certificate have expiry date you set and we need to renewed.
SNI(server name indication):sni solve the problm of loading multiple ssl certificates.works only for ALB & NLB.
How to enable SSl certificate:select load balancer->add listner->under security listner setting-> select security policy->select where this certificates are resids(we can also import the certificates)-> and done.
